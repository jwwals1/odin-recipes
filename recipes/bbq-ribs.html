            This BBQ ribs recipe may be different than others you've tried, but for super tender ribs, give it a try! 
            Lean, country-style pork ribs are boiled in seasoned water until tender, 
            then finished up in the oven under a blanket of your favorite barbecue sauce as they bake to perfection.
